	<h1>Peruvian soccer team</h1>
	<p>The Peruvian soccer team is known as "la blanquirroja", for the white ("blanco" in Spanish) and red ("rojo" in Spanish) colors of the Peruvian flag. The value of each player in the transfer market is lower than those teams that win tournaments. The Peruvian soccer team is currently not only known for the colors of its flag, but also for some of its achievements.</p>
	<p>A study on the market valuation of all the teams belonging to the South American Football Confederation places Peru in seventh place, with a value of 72 million dollars. While, Brazil, ranks first with 927 million dollars. It is followed by Argentina, with 784 million and Uruguay with 484. In fourth position is the Colombian team with a market valuation of 301 million dollars. The fifth position is occupied by Paraguay, with 128 million, followed by Chile, with 112 million. This makes the triumphs that the Peruvian team has been achieving more valuable.</p>
	<p>The last World Cup I qualified for was Spain 1982, achieving the feat of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, that is, they went to a World Cup after 36 years. In addition, this team has managed to be present in a Copa América final after 44 years. The country of Peru, a soccer lover, involved in natural, political, social and economic disasters, lived continuous sadness, and winning the qualifiers represented more than a historic triumph, there was a feeling of hope and union among the people.</p>
	<p>This magical image is dedicated to each of those players, we will know a little about them, just click on his face, and you will have some details of his life. Today I can comment that the great difference between Peru and many of the other teams is that although each player is not recognized worldwide, individually speaking, they are great because they are a team, led by a great coach like Ricardo Gareca.</p>
